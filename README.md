## About

In this section l have created built a backend REST API using Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Docker, GitHub Actions, Postgres and Test Driven Development(TDD).

---

**This REST APi can handle**:

- User authentication
- Creating objects
- Filtering and sorting objects

During development, l have gained new knowledge about TDD and smth about docker, also
I was configured Swagger for browsing my APIs.
